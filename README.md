# Materialistic for Hacker News

Materialistic is a Hacker News client for Android that is built with a clean, modern architecture and a focus on Material Design principles. It uses the official [HackerNews/API], [Algolia Hacker News Search API], and [Mercury Web Parser API] to provide a fast, reliable, and feature-rich experience.

## Project Overview

Materialistic follows a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The core components of the application are:

*   **Data Layer:** The data layer is responsible for fetching and caching data from the Hacker News API and other sources. It uses [Retrofit] for making network requests and [Room] for local data persistence.
*   **Domain Layer:** The domain layer contains the business logic of the application. It is responsible for transforming data from the data layer into a format that is easy for the presentation layer to consume.
*   **Presentation Layer:** The presentation layer is responsible for displaying data to the user and handling user interactions. It uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to separate the UI from the business logic.

## Core Components

The codebase is organized into the following packages:

*   `data`: Contains the data models, network clients, and local data sources for the application.
*   `accounts`: Contains classes for managing user accounts.
*   `appwidget`: Contains classes for implementing home screen widgets.
*   `ktx`: Contains Kotlin extension functions that are used throughout the application.
*   `activities`: Contains the activities that make up the application's UI.
*   `fragments`: Contains the fragments that are used to build the activities' UIs.
*   `viewmodels`: Contains the ViewModels that are used by the activities and fragments.
